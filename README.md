# MCS-BD

The code is for the following paper: 
``A Nonconvex Approach for Exact and Efficient Multichannel Sparse Blind Deconvolution'',
Qing Qu, Xiao Li and Zhihui Zhu.

We have include: 
	▪	landscape plot which will reproduce Figure 1 of our paper, run ‘plot_landscape.m’. 
	▪	1D experiments which will reproduce Figure 3 of our paper, run ‘convergence.m’
	▪	2D experiments which includes the 2D extension of the 1D experiments, run ‘test_2D.m’.

If the code is useful to you, please cite our paper.
